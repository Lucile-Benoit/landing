      <p>My background</p>
      <p1>As a 20-year-old girl, I lived and studied in Lyon, France, where I was fully immersed in the dynamic blend of academic pursuits and vibrant city life. As a student at a local university, I navigated my studies with curiosity and ambition, delving into subjects that ignited my intellect and passion. Outside the classroom, I loved exploring Lyon's charming streets, discovering hidden gems in its historic neighborhoods, and indulging in the city's renowned culinary delights. From strolling along the picturesque banks of the Saône River to socializing in bustling cafés, I embraced the diverse cultural experiences Lyon had to offer, enriching my education and personal growth along the way</p1>

      <p>My life</p>
      <p1>As an Erasmus girl living in Edinburgh, I began my days with scenic walks through the historic streets, marveling at the city's stunning architecture. I attended classes at the university, eager to immerse myself in new academic experiences and cultural perspectives. In the afternoons, I explored the city's vibrant neighborhoods, from the charming Old Town to the trendy cafes of Stockbridge. Evenings were spent socializing with fellow students, enjoying Scottish cuisine and lively conversations in cozy pubs. As the days wound down, I reflected on the day's adventures, grateful for the opportunity to have lived and learned in such a dynamic city.</p1>

      <p>My tips</p>
      <p1>As someone who did an Erasmus in Edinburgh, I'd advise future students to embrace the city's diverse culture and explore its historic landmarks, like Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile. It's important to engage with locals and fellow students to fully immerse yourself in the experience and make lasting connections. Don't hesitate to step out of your comfort zone and try new activities, whether it's hiking in the nearby Highlands or attending traditional Scottish ceilidhs. Prioritize time management to balance academics with exploring the city and traveling around Scotland. Lastly, cherish every moment and be open to unexpected adventures – your Erasmus experience in Edinburgh will be unforgettable.</p1>
